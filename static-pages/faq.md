### How narrowly is the term “ELN” defined? Does it include only use within the laboratories where original data is produced and recorded? Or should it be understood in a wider sense, including also data management systems? 
---

Definition of the editorial team:

An electronic lab notebook (ELN) is a specialized software for:

- the structured description of an experiment, i.e. keeping records of
  - the procedure
  - the used materials and instruments
  - the observations made during the experiment (incl. photos)
  - the metadata/description of the data generated in the experiment and, if applicable, the files (or links to them) and inferences related to it
- the long term preservation and access of all this information in compliance with long-term archival criteria

Orientation along Categorisation (Dirnagl, Przesdzing: A pocket guide to electronic laboratory notebooks in the academic life sciences, https://f1000research.com/articles/5-2/v1#SM1): The first category, pure recording systems such as Evernote, were not included. Included are primarily systems for data recording in the laboratory (e.g. Labfolder plugin with ELN functionalities) and LIMS (Laboratory Inventory Management Systems, more information about LIMS systems see https://www.lims.de/). For data management systems, we cover only the ELN components. 


### Which sources were used for the compilation of the ELN metadata? 
---
Data were compiled from a wide range of sources and with different methods, depending on their accessibility and availability: 

- The ELN item is created by the developer of the ELN or they provide the information
- The information is provided by users of the ELN or the user community 
- The information was requested from the maintainer/vendors
- The information was taken from public sources
  - Provided by the vendor (webpage, newsletter, webinars, social media)
  - Public documentation, guidance or videos of the vendor
  - Publication from researchers, review or other types of publications (e.g. overview pages)
- The information was gathered from one or more members of the editorial team by their own use of the ELN (e.g. as a demo version) or gathering access to additional information after registration on the vendor’s webpage. 


### Are the vendors included in the work of the editorial team?
---
Data were partially obtained through contacting the vendors with a questionnaire or concerning specific aspects. It is planned to send out an updated questionnaire to the vendors. 


### Are data about the number of users included? 
---
They are not included in the current version. The number of users can be an important criterion in the evaluation of different ELNs. If the vendors provide such information, they could be included. However, gathering such data is very challenging and would require that they are sent to the ELN Finder. It is beyond the capabilities of the editorial team to gather such data on our own. They might become included at a later stage, when there is e.g. an established workflow of the vendors maintaining their ELN’s items. 


### Does the ELN Finder provide any information or guidance concerning the legal aspects of implementing an ELN?
---
An ELN cannot be implemented right away. Within Germany, the employee representatives usually must approve its implementation. Help and guidance related to the legal aspects would be beneficial but are not implemented yet. It is planned to include help texts in various parts of the ELN Finder to provide definitions or explanations of terms. They might include information about legal aspects, too. 


### Which qualification should I have to become an ELN editor? 
---
Mostly experience, either from an infrastructural/data management perspective or regarding lab work (or both). Prior experience with an ELN is not necessary. We aim for a mixed editorial team, with team members coming from diverse backgrounds. In addition, you need to have time to contribute to the ELN Finder. 


### How can I enter an ELN into the ELN Finder? 
---
An ELN can be included with minimal effort through a web form. As a first step, you need to register on the ELN Finder webpage. These and all further steps are described in the [Manual for Contributors](https://eln-finder.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/docs/manual_contributors.pdf). 


### How can I provide feedback to the design and layout of the ELN Finder webpage? 
---
The editorial team appreciates any feedback about the design and functionality of the webpage and any other comments. [✉️Send us a mail](mailto:eln_finder_mailingliste@listserv.dfn.de "eln_finder_mailingliste@listserv.dfn.de")


### Where can I make suggestions for additional functionalities or improvements? 
---
The editorial team appreciates your suggestions. [✉️Send us a mail](mailto:eln_finder_mailingliste@listserv.dfn.de "eln_finder_mailingliste@listserv.dfn.de")


### Which scientific domains are covered by the ELN Finder? 
---
All scientific domains for which ELNs exist.

### What is a reference user? 
---
Explanations to this and other attributes are included in the [metadata scheme](https://doi.org/10.4126/FRL01-006452815). The editorial team appreciates any comments and suggestions, which institutions could be reference users. [✉️Send us a mail](mailto:eln_finder_mailingliste@listserv.dfn.de "eln_finder_mailingliste@listserv.dfn.de")

### What is the meaning of attribute/criterion X?
---

Explanations to the attributes and criteria are provided in the [metadata scheme](https://doi.org/10.4126/FRL01-006452815).

### What is the difference between attributes and criteria? 
---
Attributes are information about an ELN which are not relevant for the evaluation of an ELN, such as the name of a tool or the URL of the vendor. Criteria are evaluation-relevant criteria and can be filtered. In addition, there are descriptive attributes, which describe features that cannot be translated into criteria. As an example, the attribute “exit strategy” aims to summarize the effort of the developer to standardise the data exported from the ELN and related strategies. In contrast, the criterion “Data Export” provides concrete information about the different file formats for exporting content out of the ELN.
